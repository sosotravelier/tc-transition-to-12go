Introduction
Here's an overview of what you'll need to do to start booking itineraries through the Travelier Connect API

Travelier Connect offers a robust API platform built for digital travel resellers and partners who require direct access to multi-modal transportation inventory, including buses, ferries, and trains, through a single unified interface. It abstracts the complexity of working with fragmented suppliers, enabling you to build reliable and scalable travel booking experiences with minimal integration effort.

This documentation helps you understand the complete booking lifecycle, learn how to authenticate and interact with the API endpoints, review real-world request and response examples, and access environment and configuration details.

Whether you are integrating Travelier Connect into a mobile application, a web-based booking interface, or a backend system, this guide walks you through every step of the integration journey.
